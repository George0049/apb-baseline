<!--
The Transformation Epsilon parameter defines minimum, allowable,
incremental change of the transformation vector, [x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw] in
meters and radians respectively. Once the incremental change dips below this
threshold, the alignment terminates.

The Step Size parameter defines the maximum
step length allowed by the More-Thuente line search. This line search algorithm
determines the best step length below this maximum value, shrinking the step
length as you near the optimal solution. Larger maximum step lengths will be
able to clear greater distances in fewer iterations but run the risk of
overshooting and ending up in an undesirable local minimum.

Finally, the
Resolution parameter defines the voxel resolution of the internal NDT grid
structure. This structure is easily searchable and each voxel contain the
statistical data, mean, covariance, etc., associated with the points it
contains. The statistical data is used to model the cloud as a set of
multivariate Gaussian distributions and allows us to calculate and optimize the
probability of the existence of points at any position within the voxel. This
parameter is the most scale dependent. It needs to be large enough for each
voxel to contain at least 6 points but small enough to uniquely describe the
environment.

Next we need to modify some of the scale dependent parameters. Because the NDT
algorithm uses a voxelized data structure and More-Thuente line search, some
parameters need to be scaled to fit the data set. The above parameters seem to
work well on the scale we are working with, size of a room, but they would need
to be significantly decreased to handle smaller objects, such as scans of a
coffee mug.
