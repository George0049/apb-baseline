A Guide To Picking
==================

In no particular order...

1. Always wait for transforms
1. Only publish objects to the collision scene when they move
1. Do everything you can to plan less
1. Always make python ros nodes executable
1. Print AR tags in blue and white
1. Calibrate everything, always
1. Rospack profile after building/installing a new package
1. Really know your robot model
1. Every planning group needs kinematics
1. Know your joint limits
1. Know MoveIt! better
1. A days calibration, while painfull, is worthwhile
1. Always have geometries in your links
1. Run your controller over an unflooded ethernet bus
1. Ethernet switches flood easily
1. Don't plan if you don't have to - but if you do, plan lots
1. If it's not working, there is a bug
1. Visualisation markers will be flipped if scaled by a negative
1. Always publish with respect to base
1. Don't use fixed transforms on the collision scene without knowing how to use them
1. Constantly clean your camera's lenses, especially before collecting a dataset
1. When you think you know ROS, think again, go lookup the tutorials
1. Never use the deprecated function
