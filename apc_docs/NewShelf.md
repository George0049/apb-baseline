# Notes on the things that will need to change to use a new shelf

 * Calibrate the kinect and realsense again
 * Cartesian path for planning to the object has to be 100%

# Things that still need work

 * Segmentation is often incorrect - especially for shallow objects
 * Kinfu scans semi-often don't work
 * Shelf crop state fails sometimes for an unknown reason - update: seems to happen due to timing issues, maybe make more clear why it happens when this is the case
